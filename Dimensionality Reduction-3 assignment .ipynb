    "The spectral theorem is a fundamental result in linear algebra that establishes a connection between the diagonalizability of a matrix and its eigenvalues. In the context of the eigen-decomposition approach, the spectral theorem states that a matrix A is diagonalizable if and only if it has a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors. This means that A can be expressed as A = PDP^(-1), where P is a matrix composed of eigenvectors and D is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues. The spectral theorem ensures that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors provide a complete and concise representation of the matrix, allowing for efficient computations and analysis.\n"
